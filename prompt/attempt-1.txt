I want to refactor the fixture logic of this codebase. The problem I have with the current approach is that the same fixtures are used in all test, creating some tight-coupling which tend to make tests depend on each others.

I would like you to make some design proposals for a new fixture approach. Here are some constraints for this:
* Each test should only create the data it's interested in
* Do not use random data generation logic. Rely on some hardcoded data samples, possibly with some dynamic update of this data depending on the needs
* As a test developer, I should be able to instantiate a single entity if I need to, and I must be able to override the default values
* As a test developer, I should be able to instantiate several entities at once with a meaningful business association
