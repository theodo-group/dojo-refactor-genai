GitHub Copilot: I'll help you refactor the E2E test fixtures to decouple the tests. Let me start by analyzing the existing code structure and understanding the current setup. Now let me examine the entities to understand the relationships and data structure: Now let me examine the existing E2E tests to understand how they currently use the global fixtures: Now let me check the other E2E test files to understand the complete picture: Now I have a good understanding of the current structure and the problems. I can see that:

1. All tests use the same `GlobalFixtures` class which creates shared data
2. The loyalty test even demonstrates the coupling problem by modifying fixture data and commenting that it will break other tests
3. Each domain (order, customer, product, loyalty) needs its own isolated fixtures

Let me start implementing the refactored architecture. I'll create domain-specific fixtures for each area:

## Step 1: Create Order Fixtures

Made changes.

Let me fix the lint errors by marking the properties as readonly:

```


Made changes.


```

## Step 2: Create Loyalty Fixtures

Made changes.

## Step 3: Create Customer Fixtures

Made changes.

## Step 4: Create Product Fixtures

Made changes.

## Step 5: Refactor Order E2E Tests

Now I'll refactor the order tests to use the new OrderFixtures:

```


Made changes.


```

I need to update all the references to use the new testData instead of the old fixture methods. Let me fix this: Let me fix the test methods to use testData instead of the old fixture getters:

```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```

## Step 6: Refactor Loyalty E2E Tests

```


Made changes.


```

## Step 7: Refactor Customer E2E Tests

```


Made changes.


```

Let me read the rest of the customer test file to update the remaining references:

```


Made changes.


```

## Step 8: Refactor Product E2E Tests

```


Made changes.


```

Let me read the rest of the product test file and fix the remaining references:

Now let me run the tests to see if the refactoring is working correctly: Let me check the test configuration and run the tests properly: Great! The order tests are passing. Now let me test the other modules: Excellent! All tests are passing individually. Now let me test running all E2E tests together to confirm there are no side effects: Perfect! All tests are passing, including when run together. Now let me create a README to document the new fixture architecture and clean up the old global fixtures:

Made changes.

Now let me rename the old global fixtures file to indicate it's deprecated: Let me run the tests one final time to ensure everything still works after renaming the old file: I need to fix the app.e2e-spec.ts file that's still using the old global fixtures. Let me check what it does and update it: This is a simple app-level test that doesn't really need fixtures. Let me update it to remove the dependency on global fixtures:

```


Made changes.


```

Now let me run the tests one final time: Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Refactoring Complete - Summary

I have successfully refactored the E2E test fixtures architecture to decouple the tests as requested. Here's what was accomplished:

### 🎯 **Objectives Achieved**

✅ **Analyzed the existing architecture** - Identified the `GlobalFixtures` coupling issues  
✅ **Created domain-specific fixtures** - Built 4 isolated fixture classes  
✅ **Refactored all E2E tests** - Updated 4 test suites to use new fixtures  
✅ **Ensured complete isolation** - Each test suite has its own clean data  
✅ **Validated the solution** - All tests pass individually and together

### 📁 **New Fixture Architecture**

**Domain-Specific Fixtures Created:**

- order-fixtures.ts - Order domain tests
- loyalty-fixtures.ts - Loyalty program tests
- customer-fixtures.ts - Customer CRUD tests
- product-fixtures.ts - Product CRUD tests

**Each fixture provides:**

- `createTestScenario()` - Creates minimal domain-specific test data
- `cleanup()` - Properly cleans up data respecting FK constraints
- Complete isolation from other domains

### 🔄 **Test Suite Updates**

**Refactored test files:**

- order.e2e-spec.ts - Uses `OrderFixtures`
- loyalty.e2e-spec.ts - Uses `LoyaltyFixtures`
- customer.e2e-spec.ts - Uses `CustomerFixtures`
- product.e2e-spec.ts - Uses `ProductFixtures`
- app.e2e-spec.ts - Removed fixture dependency

**Key changes:**

- Added `beforeEach()` hooks for fresh data per test
- Replaced shared fixture getters with `testData` objects
- Eliminated cross-test data contamination

### 🛡️ **Benefits Delivered**

1. **Complete Test Isolation** - Each test has fresh, isolated data
2. **No Side Effects** - Tests don't interfere with each other
3. **Domain Focus** - Fixtures only create relevant data
4. **Better Maintainability** - Easier to understand and modify test scenarios
5. **Consistent Reliability** - Tests pass the same way individually or together

### 📊 **Validation Results**

- ✅ All 24 tests pass individually
- ✅ All 24 tests pass when run together
- ✅ No coupling between test suites
- ✅ Clean database state between tests
- ✅ FK constraints properly respected during cleanup

### 📚 **Documentation**

Created comprehensive documentation in README.md explaining:

- The problem that was solved
- New architecture patterns
- Migration guide for future changes
- How to run and maintain the tests

The refactoring is complete and the E2E test suite now provides reliable, isolated testing with no cross-test contamination or side effects! 🎉
