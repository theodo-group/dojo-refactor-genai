⏺ I'll help you redesign your fixtures engine. Let me
   start by exploring your current e2e tests and
  fixtures to understand the existing structure.

⏺ Current Fixtures Analysis

  I've analyzed your existing fixtures system. Here
  are the key findings:

  Current Implementation Pain Points:
  1. Global shared state - GlobalFixtures creates
  fixed data shared across all tests
  2. No isolation - Tests can interfere with each
  other through shared fixture state
  3. Weak typing - Test code in
  order.e2e-spec.ts:41-50 shows undefined types
  (Fixtures, customer(), product(), order(), given())
  4. Inconsistent API - Mix of imperative
  (fixtures.apply()) and undefined functional
  patterns (given())
  5. Hard to customize - Fixed data structure makes
  it difficult to create test-specific scenarios

  your current e2e tests and fixtures to understand the existing
  implementation.

⏺ Current Architecture Analysis

  After exploring your current fixtures system, I've identified
  several pain points:

  Current Issues:

  1. Shared Global State: All tests use the same GlobalFixtures
  instance with shared data, causing test interference (see loyalty
  test line 70 modifying fixture data)
  2. No Type Safety: Tests access fixtures via generic methods like
  getCustomers()[0] without knowing what data exists or its structure
  3. High Boilerplate: Every test file duplicates setup code
  (beforeAll, afterAll, app initialization)
  4. No Customization: Fixed data structure - can't customize
  fixtures per test or scenario
  5. Tight Coupling: Tests directly depend on hardcoded fixture data
  positions and values
  6. No Isolation: Data modifications in one test affect others (see
  loyalty test breaking other tests)

⏺ Design Decisions & Recommendations

  Key Design Principles:

  1. Test Isolation Strategy
  - Option A: Fresh database per test (slower, complete isolation)
  - Option B: Transactional rollback (faster, good isolation)
  - Recommendation: Transactional approach with cleanup hooks

  2. Type Safety Approach
  - Option A: Generic builder pattern with fluent API
  - Option B: Typed factory functions with interfaces
  - Recommendation: Typed factories with strong interfaces

  3. Data Customization
  - Option A: Builder pattern with method chaining
  - Option B: Partial override objects
  - Recommendation: Hybrid - factories with partial overrides

  4. Fixture Organization
  - Option A: Single fixtures class per entity
  - Option B: Scenario-based fixture sets
  - Recommendation: Entity-based with scenario compositions

  5. API Design Philosophy
  - Option A: Declarative (describe what you need)
  - Option B: Imperative (build step by step)
  - Recommendation: Declarative with imperative escape hatches

  Proposed API Design:

  // Declarative fixture creation
  const fixtures = await FixtureEngine.create()
    .withCustomers({ count: 2, traits: ['premium'] })
    .withProducts({ count: 5, categories: ['pizza', 'salad'] })
    .withOrders({ count: 3, customerIndex: 0 })
    .build();

  // Type-safe access
  const customer = fixtures.customers[0]; // Fully typed
  const order = fixtures.orders.first(); // Helper methods

  What aspects would you like to discuss further before I proceed
  with the implementation?

> 1. OK Transaction\
  2. I prefer using records, and key to type strongly\
  \
  fixtures.withCustomer({alice: customer({name: 'Alice'}) // overrides 
  default\
  .withProdcut({pizza: product({name: "pizza", price: 10.0}), soda: 
  product( {...}))\
  .withOrders({alice: order('alice', ['pizza', 'soda'], {status: 
  'pending'})\
  \
  ...\
  \
  fixtures.customers.alice\
  fixtures.orders.alice \
  \
  3.OK hybrid\
  4. scenario composition\
  5. declarative\
